# Port Philosophy

This is a complete porting program, not a typed wrapper layer over WordPress.

The long-term destination is Haxe-authored executable knowledge for WordPress/Gutenberg runtime logic and public adapter contracts, with generated PHP/TypeScript/JavaScript artifacts preserving the public ecosystem contracts. A typed compatibility layer is useful early, but only as scaffolding: it lets us inventory APIs, prove target semantics, generate ABI shells, run oracles, and move one vertical slice at a time.

PHP remains the required WordPress compatibility target, but it should be one generated adapter over Haxe-owned semantics and ABI metadata. We should not bury behavior or shell contracts in hand-written PHP/JavaScript runner strings, because that makes later retargeting to another runtime or language depend on reverse-engineering PHP scaffolding instead of reusing Haxe source.

PHP is privileged, not symmetric with future native targets. Unmodified plugins and themes execute in PHP and observe PHP engine semantics, so the current parity goal is PHP-hosted, Haxe-authored WordPress. Rust or another native runtime may later provide optional internal kernels behind generated adapters and PHP fallbacks, but "Rust core with PHP plugin compatibility" is an explicit non-goal for the current parity milestone.

The useful split is:

- semantic ownership: Haxe owns migrated WordPress behavior;
- adapter-contract ownership: Haxe owns the PHP-visible ABI/effect contract;
- emission strategy: stock Haxe PHP, typed adapter IR, linker emitter, temporary import, or backend improvement;
- execution provider: PHP/Haxe-generated PHP now, optional native provider later;
- evidence level: fixture, bridge, installed differential, upstream suite, or ecosystem corpus.

## Bootstrap Layer vs. Destination

The initial typed layer should provide:

- exact public ABI facades;
- original-path shells;
- Haxe-owned metadata for adapter generation;
- typed access to PHP globals, arrays, references, hooks, includes, and templates;
- generated package/export/script-handle metadata;
- differential test harnesses and receipts.

It should not become a permanent thin wrapper around upstream PHP/JS implementations. Each wrapped upstream behavior needs an ownership state: external oracle, temporary bridge, scaffolded Haxe, Haxe parity candidate, or verified Haxe-owned. The machine-readable version of this policy is `manifests/schemas/ownership-manifest.schema.json`; the operating rules are in `docs/operations/ownership-state-model.md`.

## Fixing Smells

We should fix design smells when the evidence says the smell is real and the compatibility boundary is protected.

Before parity, fixes are allowed when they:

- do not change observable WordPress/Gutenberg behavior;
- reduce porting risk or repeated mistakes;
- make unsupported constructs explicit;
- improve deterministic generation or testing;
- are guarded by upstream/differential tests.

After a subsystem reaches parity, refactor tasks may improve internal design more aggressively while preserving public behavior. The rule is not "copy WordPress forever"; it is "capture behavior first, then improve behind tested boundaries."

## Practical Rule

Start with typed compatibility surfaces where WordPress's dynamic contract is dangerous to translate blindly. Use those surfaces to replace runtime logic with Haxe-owned implementations in small verified slices. Do not stop at wrappers unless a task records an approved temporary exception with a removal gate.

Preserve PHP where PHP semantics are observable. Use Haxe to own how that PHP is generated. Use native code only where PHP observability ends.
