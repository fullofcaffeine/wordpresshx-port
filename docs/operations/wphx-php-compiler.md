# WPHX PHP Compiler

`WPHX-COMP-PHP` starts the in-repo custom PHP emitter for WordPress-shaped public files.

The compiler is a Haxe/Reflaxe module under `src/wphx/compiler/php`. It uses Reflaxe manual output so emitted file paths can be WordPress distribution paths such as `wp-includes/*.php`, not merely Haxe package paths. Reflaxe is loaded through the explicit classpath recorded in `toolchain.lock.json` and `upstream.lock.json`.

The current strategy, accepted after oracle review on 2026-06-29 and formalized in [ADR-013](../adr/ADR-013-wphx-php-adapter-ir-and-scope.md), is intentionally hybrid:

- stock Haxe PHP emits private Haxe implementation classes and remains the reference for stdlib/runtime behavior;
- WPHX PHP emits bounded WordPress original-path public adapter files;
- typed Haxe source, metadata, Adapter IR, and manifests are the durable asset, not generated PHP strings.

Do not assume stock Haxe PHP can directly generate public WordPress Core files with the ABI, file topology, reference behavior, warning behavior, stack traces, and include timing modern WordPress requires. Public WordPress files must pass WPHX public-shell gates. Conversely, do not expand WPHX PHP into a full backend unless minimized evidence shows the hybrid cannot preserve required behavior.

Use the native Haxe PHP generator and `std/php` sources in `../haxe.compilerdev.reference/haxe` as an implementation oracle for generic, borrowable lowering/runtime behavior when useful. That reference can guide what to reuse or adapt; WordPress public ABI, original path topology, declaration timing, and ecosystem-visible behavior still require WordPress oracle fixtures and WPHX public-shell evidence.

## Current Invocation

```bash
npm run wphx:php:smoke
npm run wphx:php:smoke:check
npm run wphx:php:f1
npm run wphx:php:f1:check
npm run wphx:php:f4
npm run wphx:php:f4:check
npm run wphx:php:byref-arg
npm run wphx:php:byref-arg:check
npm run wphx:php:wp-http-parser-helpers
npm run wphx:php:wp-http-parser-helpers:check
npm run wphx:php:wp-http-chunk-transfer-decode
npm run wphx:php:wp-http-chunk-transfer-decode:check
```

The smoke fixture compiles with:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/smoke.hxml
```

The HXML enables:

- `--macro wphx.compiler.php.CompilerInit.Start()`
- `-D wphx_php_output=build/wphx-php/smoke`
- `-D wphx_php_manifest=build/wphx-php/smoke/wphx-php-emission.v1.json`
- `-D wphx_php_profile=wordpress`

The F1 facade driver compiles the stock Haxe fixture implementation plus a compiler-emitted shell:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/f1-facade.hxml
```

It emits `build/wphx-php/f1/generated/wp-includes/plugin.php`, lints that PHP, runs the same reflection and behavior probe as the F1 oracle path, and verifies the manifest records `global-function:add_filter`.

The F4 facade driver emits the public interface/base-class/class shell:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/f4-public-class.hxml
```

It emits `build/wphx-php/f4/generated/wp-includes/class-wphx-public-class.php`, lints that PHP, runs the same reflection and object-behavior probe as the F4 oracle path, and verifies the manifest records `interface:WPHX_Public_Interface`, `class:WPHX_Public_Base`, and `class:WPHX_Public_Class`.

The by-reference ABI driver compiles a small original-path global-function fixture:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/byref-arg.hxml
```

It emits `build/wphx-php/byref-arg/generated/wp-includes/wphx-byref.php`, lints that PHP, verifies PHP reflection sees `&$value`, verifies the neighboring default parameter remains intact, and executes the generated function to prove the caller variable mutates through the reference. This is a generic compiler step toward WordPress helpers such as `WP_Http::buildCookieHeader( &$r )`, not a claim over that helper yet.

The first WordPress Core public-method driver reuses the WPHX-312.61 chunk-transfer fixture:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/wp-http-chunk-transfer-decode.hxml
```

The runner emits `build/wp-core/wphx-312-61/generated/wp-includes/class-wp-http.php`, lints that PHP, runs the existing WPHX-312.61 oracle/candidate probe, and verifies the WPHX PHP manifest records `class:WP_Http` with no unsupported constructs.

The first grouped WordPress Core public-method driver reuses the WPHX-312.60 process-response runner and compiles a shared parser-helper facade:

```bash
haxe fixtures/wphx-php/wp-http-parser-helpers.hxml
```

The runner emits `build/wp-core/wphx-312-60/generated/wp-includes/class-wp-http.php` with `WP_Http::processResponse`, `WP_Http::chunkTransferDecode`, and protected `WP_Http::parse_url`, lints that PHP, runs oracle/candidate probes for all three helper cases, and verifies the WPHX PHP manifest records `class:WP_Http` with no unsupported constructs. This is the current model for replacing copied or JS-patched PHP shells with compiler-emitted original-path adapters while keeping stock Haxe PHP responsible for runtime implementation classes and stdlib behavior.

## Adapter IR

The WPHX PHP compiler now uses an Adapter IR before printing PHP:

```text
typed Haxe source and metadata
  -> WPHX Adapter IR file/declaration plans
  -> deterministic original-path PHP adapter printer
  -> wphx-php-emission.v1.json
```

The v0 IR in `src/wphx/compiler/php/WphxPhpCompiler.hx` covers the proven public-shell shapes: original-path files, guarded global functions, classes/interfaces, methods, properties, constants, Haxe bootstrap markers, protected methods, by-reference parameters, and manifest declarations.

This IR is deliberately narrower than a full PHP backend. Add new nodes only when a fixture or WordPress slice needs them, and pair each addition with generated-shape, static/runtime ABI, behavior, and receipt evidence as appropriate. The next expected nodes are native PHP array mutation/default-shape lowering for `WP_Http::buildCookieHeader`, conditionals/loops for richer `processHeaders`, conditional declaration segments, and include-time side-effect/script nodes.

## First Contract

The initial metadata contract is intentionally small:

- `@:wp.file("wp-includes/name.php")` selects the generated PHP output path.
- `@:wp.global("function_name")` emits a module-level Haxe function as a global PHP function.
- `@:native("Class_Name")` emits an annotated Haxe class with that public PHP class name.
- `@:wp.ifMissing` wraps generated functions/classes in `function_exists` or `class_exists(..., false)` guards.
- `@:wp.haxeBootstrap("CONSTANT_NAME")` emits a guarded stock Haxe PHP runtime bootstrap for facade shells that delegate to Haxe-generated implementation classes.
- `@:wp.order(n)` orders multiple declarations that share one generated PHP file.
- `@:wp.const` emits a static field as a PHP class constant.
- `@:wp.byRef` emits a PHP `&$parameter` for reference-visible ABI boundaries.
- `@:wp.visibility("protected")`, `@:wp.name("name")`, and `@:wp.defaultArray` preserve PHP reflection-visible class/member/static-method/parameter ABI when Haxe's source-level spelling differs.

The emitter also writes `wphx-php-emission.v1.json` with generated paths, declarations, source modules, hashes-by-runner evidence, and unsupported construct notes.

## Scope

This is not yet a full PHP backend. The first verified behavior is global functions, by-reference parameters, public interfaces/classes, inheritance/implements, constants, constructors, instance/static methods, public/protected/static properties, simple expressions, facade/bootstrap delegation, bounded WordPress Core public-method adapters, PHP lint, and PHP execution. New language features should be added only when a facade, linker, or WordPress driver fixture needs them.

The generator should reuse or adapt Haxe stdlib and stock PHP target behavior wherever practical, using `../haxe.compilerdev.reference/haxe` as the reference for std/php lowering. WordPress-specific metadata and lowering are acceptable for original paths, conditional declarations, reflection-visible ABI, native PHP array boundaries, and plugin/theme compatibility, but they should remain named and bounded rather than becoming a parallel reimplementation of the Haxe PHP target.

The next target gate is expanding grouped original-path adapters beyond parser leaf helpers toward richer public ABI shapes such as references, conditional declarations, and neighboring header/cookie helpers. The full `WP_Http::request` method remains deliberately later.
