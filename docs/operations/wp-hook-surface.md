# WordPress Hook Surface

WPHX-302 records the first complete hook/plugin API surface gate for `plugin.php` and
`class-wp-hook.php`.

## Contract

- The oracle is the locked WordPress 7.0 checkout at `../wordpress-develop`.
- The expected symbols come from `manifests/php-abi/wordpress-7.0-core-abi.v1.json`.
- The generated side reuses the F7 hook kernel fixture and original-path generated files.
- The probe reflects every function, class, method, and property in the hook workset.
- The behavior fixture compares deprecated hooks, ref-array actions, remove-all helpers,
  plugin path helpers, activation/deactivation hooks, and uninstall hook registration.

## Ownership

The ownership manifest intentionally marks this workset as a `temporary_bridge`. Hook
callbacks, references, globals, and plugin lifecycle helpers remain PHP-observable. This
gate proves compatibility while later source-unit work can move the hook kernel toward
`haxe_parity_candidate` ownership.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run wp:hooks:surface
npm run wp:hooks:surface:check
```

Evidence is recorded in:

- `manifests/wp-hooks/wphx-302-hook-surface.v1.json`
- `manifests/ownership/wphx-302-hooks-workset.v1.json`
- `receipts/wp-hooks/wphx-302-hook-surface.v1.json`

## WPHX-302.01 Candidate Model

WPHX-302.01 adds a typed Haxe parity-candidate model for hook decisions that can be
tested without copying the generated PHP shell into `php.Syntax.code` strings. The
candidate covers priority ordering/removal, current hook stack checks, filter/action
counters, callback arity decisions, and plugin basename/lifecycle hook names.

The public `plugin.php` and `class-wp-hook.php` shell remains a bounded bridge until
WPHX-302.02 can replace PHP-observable callback/reference/global behavior with typed Haxe
runtime boundaries while keeping generated PHP idiomatic for existing plugins.

Run:

```bash
npm run wp:hooks:parity-candidate
npm run wp:hooks:parity-candidate:check
```

Evidence is recorded in:

- `manifests/wp-hooks/wphx-302-01-hook-parity-candidate.v1.json`
- `manifests/ownership/wphx-302-01-hooks-decision-model.v1.json`
- `receipts/wp-hooks/wphx-302-01-hook-parity-candidate.v1.json`

## WPHX-302.02 Runtime Boundary

WPHX-302.02 moves bounded hook shell decisions into shared typed Haxe runtime code in
`src/wphx/wp/hooks/HookRuntime.hx`. The generated public PHP shell delegates priority
normalization, counter increments, dispatch arity decisions, filter/action value-write
decisions, default action args, plugin basename trimming, lifecycle hook names, and
plugin realpath registration decisions through the typed facade.

The shell intentionally keeps PHP-native callbacks, by-reference arrays, globals,
reflection-visible declarations, and include timing at the public boundary. WPHX-302.03 owns
moving the remaining broad PHP shell emission out of the JavaScript template and into
Haxe-owned source, a macro/emitter, a generic Haxe PHP backend improvement, or an
ADR-approved Reflaxe/custom PHP target.

Run:

```bash
npm run wp:hooks:runtime-boundary
npm run wp:hooks:runtime-boundary:check
```

Evidence is recorded in:

- `manifests/wp-hooks/wphx-302-02-hook-runtime-boundary.v1.json`
- `manifests/ownership/wphx-302-02-hooks-runtime-boundary.v1.json`
- `receipts/wp-hooks/wphx-302-02-hook-runtime-boundary.v1.json`

## WPHX-302.03 Shell Emitter

WPHX-302.03 removes the broad JavaScript-authored public shell templates from the F7
generator. The generator now reads the locked WordPress 7.0 `plugin.php` and
`class-wp-hook.php` oracle files and applies counted source transforms that insert the
typed Haxe runtime boundary. This keeps the generated public PHP shell idiomatic and close
to upstream while preventing runtime behavior from being hand-pasted into JavaScript
templates.

WPHX-302.04 owns the final verified distribution-surface promotion, including provenance,
source maps, and review of any remaining PHP-native public ABI bridges.

Run:

```bash
npm run wp:hooks:shell-emitter
npm run wp:hooks:shell-emitter:check
```

Evidence is recorded in:

- `manifests/wp-hooks/wphx-302-03-hook-shell-emitter.v1.json`
- `manifests/ownership/wphx-302-03-hooks-shell-emitter.v1.json`
- `receipts/wp-hooks/wphx-302-03-hook-shell-emitter.v1.json`

## WPHX-302.04 Distribution Surface

WPHX-302.04 promotes the hook/plugin API workset to `verified_haxe_owned`. The
remaining PHP-native pieces are no longer treated as temporary bridges: callbacks,
by-reference argument arrays, public globals, reflection-visible declarations, and include
timing are approved public ABI boundaries because existing plugins observe those details.

The distribution-surface gate verifies WPHX-302 through WPHX-302.03, checks that the earlier
hook ownership manifests no longer contain temporary `bridge` or `removal_gate` blocks, and
records generated-shell provenance plus line-range source maps for `plugin.php` and
`class-wp-hook.php`. Upstream WordPress files remain locked source/provenance oracles; Haxe
`HookRuntime`/`HookKernel` owns the hook decisions inserted into the generated distribution
shells.

Run:

```bash
npm run wp:hooks:distribution-surface
npm run wp:hooks:distribution-surface:check
```

Evidence is recorded in:

- `manifests/wp-hooks/wphx-302-04-hook-distribution-surface.v1.json`
- `manifests/ownership/wphx-302-04-hooks-distribution-surface.v1.json`
- `receipts/wp-hooks/wphx-302-04-hook-distribution-surface.v1.json`
